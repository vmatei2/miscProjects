    "    - **Verstatility:** Used in wide range of fields, web development / data science, analysis, visualisation / scientific computing\n",
    "    - **Learning process:** Focuses on readability and simplicity. Syntax is very much like human speech, hence as a user, the learning curve to being able to write functioning code isn't as big as other languages   (also easier to read/understand other people's code, big part of programming).\n",
    "    Provides abstraction from the details of the computer, hence users can focus on solving problems directly.\n",
    "    - **Large Community:** Building on the two points above, Python has a very large user community. Whatever problem you are trying to solve, it is very likely that someone else has solved it already or another similar one, and the answer can be found online/adapted to your own requirements.\n",
    "    - **Data analysis and visualisation:** Specific libraries created by others that can be used to manipulate, explore and visualise large data sets. Does not require a lot of setup, hence powerful tool when working with data and trying to understand and present it."
